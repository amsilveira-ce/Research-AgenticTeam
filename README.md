##  The Problem: Why Traditional Research Slows Us Down

Whether in academia or industry, literature reviews often suffer from the same bottlenecks:

### **1. Slow & Manual Work**

Researchers spend countless hours crafting search queries, jumping between databases like PubMed, arXiv, or CrossRef, and manually piecing results together. This slows discovery and increases the chance of missing key insights.

### **2. Subjective Screening**

Keyword-based filtering can overlook important research. Two people reviewing the same set of papers may make different decisions—introducing inconsistency and gaps.

### **3. Difficult to Scale**

Managing multiple hypotheses, tracking thousands of results, and ensuring completeness becomes nearly impossible without large teams and heavy manual effort.

## The Solution: An Autonomous, AI-Powered Research Workflow

**Research-AgenticTeam** transforms the literature review process by using a coordinated team of AI agents built with LangGraph.
Instead of a human manually conducting every step, each stage is handled by a specialized autonomous component.

### **How It Works: A Collaborative AI System**

| **Agent**            | **Role**   | **What It Does**                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planner Agent**    | Strategy   | Understands the research goal and turns it into clear, testable hypotheses with optimized search terms.                                 |
| **Researcher Agent** | Discovery  | Conducts targeted searches across the right academic databases automatically—selecting the appropriate tools for each discipline.       |
| **Curator Agent**    | Validation | Uses semantic analysis and reasoning to score and filter papers, ensuring only the most relevant, high-quality results make it through. |
| **Report Generator** | Synthesis  | Assembles findings, insights, and tool usage details into a polished, structured research report in Markdown.                           |
